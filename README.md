# HuffmanCoding  
Our goal is to design and implement a file compression/decompression algorithm called "Huffman Coding" by using a priority queue data structure.  
In this project I used Python language to do required tasks.  
My project folder consists of two python files. One includes all required classes and functions.  
Other one is executable file. Also input “file5.text” text file is present.  
When we execute the “HuffmanCodeExcecute.py” file, program will generate these files.  
“FreqFile.txt”  
“encodedFile5.txt”  
“decodedFile5.txt”
